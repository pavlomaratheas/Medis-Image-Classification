In this project we developed a classification model based on DenseNet121 (implemented through MONAI), adapted to three classes corresponding to heart, liver, and lung. Images are preprocessed by resizing them to 224×224 pixels, converting them into tensors, and normalizing with ImageNet statistics; for the training set we also apply simple data augmentation (random horizontal flip and 15° rotation) to improve generalization. The optimization is performed with the Adam algorithm (learning rate 1e−3) and the CrossEntropyLoss function, while the evaluation relies on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Training is organized through 5-Fold Stratified Cross-Validation, providing a more robust estimate of performance. The key hyperparameters are: batch size 16, 5 training epochs, and learning rate 1e−3.

To reproduce the results, one only needs to set up a Python environment (version 3.10 or higher), install the required libraries (torch, torchvision, pytorch–lightning, monai, torchmetrics, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn), and run the train_lightning.py script. The script automatically extracts the data from Data.zip, prepares the datasets, and launches the training with cross-validation, printing classification reports and confusion matrices.

The results obtained with the PyTorch Lightning implementation show that the model can achieve high accuracy, particularly on the Liver and Lung classes, while performance on the Heart class remains weaker due to lower recall. Across the five folds, we observed some variability, but the aggregated classification report indicates an overall accuracy of 87%, with macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1 around 0.76. These results suggest that the model generalizes reasonably well, although class imbalance still affects sensitivity to certain categories.

In addition to the main PyTorch Lightning implementation, the repository also includes the files model.py and train_eval.py. These were developed as an alternative exercise, first by adapting a ResNet-based model and then by implementing a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) without using PyTorch Lightning. Their purpose was mainly educational, to explore different approaches and gain a better understanding of model design and basic evaluation metrics.
